Requirements

Create a Spring app with the following libraries added:
Web
DevTools
JPA
H2
PostGreSQL
You can use either H2 or PostGreSQL for this project.
Extract the aforementioned zip file, rename the directory to public, and put it in your project.
Create GET and POST routes for /lecturers and /reviews
The /lecturers POST route must take the following query parameters: name, topic, and image
The /reviews POST route must take the following query parameters: author, text, lecturerId, and isGood
The /lecturers GET route must return a JSON array of objects that have an id, name, topic, and image
The /reviews GET route must return a JSON array of objects that have an id, author, text, lecturerId, and isGood
Optional: Improve the UI so it properly updates after creating a lecturer and a review.
Optional: Change the front and back end code to send JSON to the POST routes instead of query parameters.
